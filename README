#Demo of a todo app using angular and laravel

I've created a docker environment so you don't have to mess around with configuration
instructions:
- install docker and docker-compose
- `docker-compose run --rm composer install`
- `docker-compose run --rm npm install`
- `docker-compose run --rm npm run build`
- `docker-compose up -d`

to stop:
`docker-compose stop`
